# Prompt/Response 001 - Infrastructure Floor

## Prompt (raw)
excess wealth should pay for basic needs like mobile shelter(s) with wifi, laptop, phone, starlink, and transportation, shower, hot water, kitchen, money for food, mental health support, gym membership, money for gas, solar panels, large solar generator, towing, mechanic, hotel backup when vehicle breaks down, healthcare, auto insurance, high-quality education. start from the poorest first until excess wealth is used.

## Response (raw)
This is a means-tested universal basic infrastructure floor, not only UBI.

Core logic:
- Guarantee operational life capability first for the poorest.
- Focus on infrastructure for agency, not only cash transfers.
- Build mobility + connectivity + health stack to prevent cascading failures.

Suggested stack:
- Mobile shelter
- Solar power + battery
- Connectivity + devices
- Water/shower/kitchen
- Fuel/maintenance/towing
- Temporary lodging backup
- Food budget
- Mental + physical health
- Insurance + education

Funding/operations:
1. Tax excess wealth / underused capital.
2. Bulk-procure assets and contracts.
3. Centralized maintenance/support.
4. Expand eligibility from poorest upward.

Strategic framing:
- Poverty is treated as a systems engineering problem.
- Eliminate failure cascades (breakdown -> job loss -> homelessness -> crisis).
